# 2ndWeekJavascript
Let's have a deeper look at the working of traffic lights this week so that we can practice logic and loops. In traffic-light-1.js and traffic-light-2.js you will find the same requirements but with different ways of representing the traffic light. Have a look through the files and solve them so you can see how the way we represent data affects the way we need to solve problems.
